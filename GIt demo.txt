 how to fork a repository on platforms like GitHub:

    Go to the original repository's page on the platform.
    Click the "Fork" button.
    This will create a copy of the repository in your account.

After forking, you can clone your fork to your local machine, make changes,
 and then push those changes to your fork. 
 From there, you can create a pull request (or equivalent) to suggest changes
  to the original repository.

Forking is a powerful way to contribute to open-source projects, 
collaborate with others, and maintain your own versions of code 
repositories while preserving the integrity of the original project.
